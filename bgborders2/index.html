    <title>Backgrounds and Borders: Task 1</title>

  <!-- In this task we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:

    Give the box a 5px lightblue border, and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px
    The heading uses the star.png image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
    Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this. -->
